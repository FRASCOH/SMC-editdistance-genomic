# Secure Multiparty Computation - Implementation of Edit Distance in Genomics

In the current context of personalized medicine and the increasing availability of genomic data, the revolutionary potential of genetic information is accompanied by a critical challenge: how to ensure the security and confidentiality of such valuable resources? With the widespread use of genomic sequencing, there is an urgent need to explore innovative methodologies for sharing and analyzing data without compromising individual privacy. The objective of this paper is to address this crucial challenge, with a specific focus on the secure computation of edit distance in genomic contexts. An analysis of optimizations in this process reveals an advanced approach to enable robust and private analysis, thereby supporting the promising evolution of precision medicine. The investigation focuses on the security and performance of calculations in genomic contexts, with particular attention to optimizations in the secure computation of edit distance between DNA sequences. Thanks to technological advancements, access to genomic sequencing has experienced significant expansion, generating a vast repository of genomic data. However, the sharing and analysis of such data must confront significant challenges, especially in terms of security and privacy, given the uniqueness of genomic sequences and their ability to identify individual entities.
To effectively address the challenge of security and privacy in genomic computations, a particularly promising approach is the use of Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). SMC is an advanced cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties to perform calculations on shared data without revealing sensitive information to each other. In the genomic context, the application of SMC enables collaboration between research institutions and medical centers, allowing them to analyze genomic data without directly sharing complete genetic sequences. This would represent a significant step forward in privacy protection, as sensitive information would remain encrypted throughout the entire analysis process. The implementation of SMC requires a rigorous evaluation of security policies and the definition of appropriate protocols to ensure a secure computational environment. However, once these parameters are established, SMC could emerge as a valuable tool to balance the need to share genomic data for research with the crucial importance of protecting individual privacy. Furthermore, the integration of SMC could significantly contribute to strengthening individuals' trust in sharing their genomic data for research purposes, thus supporting the ethical and secure growth of precision medicine.
The primary motivation for this research lies in the need to balance the innovative progress of precision medicine, based on genomic information, with the protection of individual privacy and information security. The goal is to propose optimized solutions for the secure computation, through Secure Multiparty Computation, of edit distance, maintaining temporal efficiency and ensuring the confidentiality of genomic data. Through this research, the aim is to contribute to the development of advanced methodologies for the secure computation of edit distance in genomic settings, enabling the analysis of sensitive data in a confidential and efficient manner.
